# Video Game Design course - 2018/2019 - Course Project
Introductory game project for Unreal Engine 4.

**NOTE**: to avoid commiting lightmass files into the VCS, maps are committed with no precomputed lighting. To build static lightmaps: open the map, go to *Settings* > *World Settings* > *Lightmass* > *[Advanced]* > unset *Force No Precomputed Lighting*, then *Build*.

**NOTE**: to avoiding commiting the whole "*Starter Content*" package, it's listed into `.gitignore` as it is automatically added by UE4 on load. So don't modify its content as changes will be lost.
